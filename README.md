# insurance_policies_analysis
### Background:
This insurance policy analysis project aims to explore and analyze data related to insurance policies. Insurance is an industry that is critical in protecting individuals and companies from unforeseen financial risks. In this project, we will extract information from an insurance policies dataset that includes variables such as ID, date of birth, marital status, car usage, gender, number of children driving, education, car make, car model, car color, car year, frequency of claims, zone of coverage, number of claims, and household income.

The dataset used is a collection of insurance policies data which contains information related to insurance policies. This dataset includes various variables that reflect customer profiles and information related to insurance claims. This dataset is arranged in a structured format and ready for analysis.

### Purpose of Analysis:
The main objective of this analysis is to gain insight and deeper understanding of insurance policies, including claim patterns, customer characteristics, and factors that influence insurance claims. This analysis will include the use of descriptive statistical analysis methods, data visualization, and possibly also the application of predictive models. Several research questions that will be answered through this analysis include:

What is the average age of the customer (provide mean and median)? Does age number affect the number of claims filed?
Is there a relationship between car use, gender, and the number of children driving and the frequency of insurance claims?
How is the distribution of the number of claims and the average number of claims by coverage zone? and so on.
By analyzing this dataset, it is hoped that we can gain valuable insights that can support insurance decision-making and assist in the development of strategies that are more effective in managing risk.
